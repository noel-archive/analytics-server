# Noelware Analytics :: Agent
This is the analytics agent that makes sending your data from the agent to Noelware Analytics is safe and tidy as possible without doing the heavy work yourself. Though, if you don't want to use this, you can always implement the Protocol Buffers yourself or use the official libraries vendored by Noelware.
